description: In the future, advanced technology has made it possible to perform "mind-swapping"
  procedures that implant one person's memories, skills, beliefs, and feelings into
  another's brain. Predictably, scam artists have begun to employ this technique for
  nefarious purposes. In Star Hunter, that's exactly what happens to down-on-his-luck
  janitor Vye Lansor, who finds himself on an unfamiliar planet with a new set of
  memories. Will the ploy work, or will Lansor fight back? Read Star Hunter to find
  out.
